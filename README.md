added styling using bootstrap 12-24-2021 T. Santos

Summary
- This is the first time I tried using bootstrap to design a UI
- Not mobile friendly
    - bootstrap 12 column grid forces UI to break for game

What I learned?
- Don't design game UIs with bootstrap.
    - bootstrap works goods for content but not game UI
- Bootstrap class system is overconvuluted and opinionated
- Designing your own flexbox grid layout works better and is more unopinionated
